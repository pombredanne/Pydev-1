<p>Ok, now that you're already up and running, let's <b>run a program from within Eclipse</b> with PyDev.</p>

<p>For that, we will extend the module we created in the previous chapter with the following program:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">if</span> __name__ <span style="color: #666666">==</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;__main__&#39;</span>:
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span>(<span style="color: #BA2121">&#39;Hello World&#39;)</span>
</pre></div>

</div></div>
<p>Then, to run the file you can:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="circle">
	<li>Use a shortcut: <b>F9</b> to run the open editor based on the project configuration where the module is contained (or for debug mode <b>Shift+F9</b>).</li>
	<li>Go to the menu: Alt + R + S + The number of the Run you wish (It can be Python, Jython, unit-test, etc).</li>
	<li>Note: if you were using <b>unit-tests</b>, you could use: <b>Ctrl+F9</b> to run the unit-tests from the module (and even selecting which tests should be run -- and if <b>Shift</b> is pressed it's launched in debug mode).</li>
	<ul>
	    <li>Tip: you may want to pre-select the test to be run in the editor (with <b>Ctrl+Shift+Up</b> or <b>Ctrl+Shift+Down</b>) so that <b>Ctrl+F9</b> will have that test pre-selected to run.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>


<p><b>NOTE</b>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>External files may be launched, but an associated project must be available. So, a file may be dragged from the filesystem into 
Eclipse and later, with the editor open <b>F9</b> may be pressed to run the file... </p>

<p>It'll still ask for a project to resolve the PYTHONPATH and interpreter to be used (you can probably just use any project 
you have that has the interpreter you want to use for the run or create a PyDev project as 'external_projects' and bind those runs to it).</p>

<p>-- The configuration created may be changed later on in the menu: <b>Run &gt; Run Configurations</b>.</p></blockquote>

By launching a file, the console should be brough forward with the output of the code (if you had some exception raised, clicking on it would bring you to the code in the stack-trace).</p>

<p>After the first run, using <b>Ctrl+F11</b>, the last file should be re-run. Or, if you type just <b>F11</b>, a debug session is started with your last run.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: This behavior changed in Eclipse 3.3 &#8211; but it's generally recommended to restore it in the preferences at: 
<b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Run/Debug &gt; Launching</b> and set the Launch Operation to <b>Always launch the previously launched application</b>. 
This tutorial will always consider this as the default option.</p>

<p>Now, let's go on to starting a debug session. First, you'll need to add a breakpoint in the 
<strong>print('Hello World')</strong> line. To do so, go to that line, use <b>Ctrl+F10</b> and select 
'Add breakpoint' (or double-click the left ruler), then use the <b>F11</b> to re-run the last launch. Doing so, will trigger you to go to the <b>debug perspective</b>. You should say <b>yes</b> to this dialog.</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><br/><img src="images/perspective_to_debug.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></span><br/>
After saying yes, you should be brought to the perspective below.</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><br/><img src="images/debug_perspective.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></span><br/>
In this perspective, the debug actions are activated and presented to<br/>
you, so, you can use:</p>

<p> <b>F5</b>: Step into</p>

<p> <b>F6</b>: Step over</p>

<p> <b>F7</b>: Step return</p>

<p> <b>F8</b>: Resume execution</p>

<p> <b>Ctrl+Shift+B</b>: Toggle Breakpoints</p>

<p> <b>Ctrl+Alt+R</b>: Set Next Statement (so, in the example above, you could set the <b>if __name__ == "__main__"</b> as the next line to be executed).</p>

<p>Use line prefixed with <b>>>></b> in the console to evaluate expressions.</p>

<p>After the debug session, you can return to the previous perspective by using <b>Ctrl+F8</b> (this keybinding iterates through the open perspectives)... 
And while we are at it, <b>Ctrl+F7</b> iterates through the views and <b>Ctrl+F6</b> iterates through the editors.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: you can also add those actions to other perspectives by customizing the perspective (in 
<b>Window &gt; Perspective &gt; > Customize Perspective ... > Action Set availability</b> enable the <b>Breakpoints</b> and <b>Debug</b> options)</p>
