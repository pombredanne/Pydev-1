PyDev 5.8.0 Released

PyDev 5.8.0 Release Highlights
-------------------------------

* **Important** PyDev now requires Java 8 and Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) onwards.

    * PyDev 5.2.0 is the last release supporting Eclipse 4.5 (Mars).


* **Code Analysis**

	* Fixed issue getting existing PyLint markers.
	* There's now an Info and an Ignore level.

* **Debugger**

	* The debugger now provides hooks for clients and provides ways to extend the handling of custom types. See: https://github.com/fabioz/PyDev.Debugger/tree/master/pydevd_plugins/extensions (patch by **Yuli Fiterman**).
	* Fixed issue where the debugger could end up removing quotes on args. **#PyDev-797**
	* The debugger now works with IronPython again -- although note that **IronPython** **2.7.6** and **2.7.7** have a critical bug which prevents IronPython from working in PyDev: https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/issues/1663

* **Code Coverage**

	* Fixed issue getting code-coverage version. **#PyDev-791**
	* Properly works when running with pytest (provided that pytest-cov is installed).

* **Others**

	* Update .yaml file for google app engine project templates (patch by **JunjieW**).
	* Upgraded Lucene to 6.1.0 (patch by **Sopot Cela**).
	* Update docstring from parameters (Ctrl+1 on **def**) properly considers sphinx with types. **#PyDev-787**
	* Code Completion: Properly finding **__init__** from superclass in inherited classes. **#PyDev-802**
	* No longer showing icon to start interactive console in toolbar because Eclipse could end up creating multiple entries which were shown forever. **#PyDev-708**
	* Other minor bugfixes.
